# Chapter 1 Problem 1

Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?

## IDEAL 
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><B>I:</B></th>
    <th>This algorithm finds whether a string has repeating characters or not.</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><B>D:</B></td>
    <td>Write and algorithm using a data structure, and another one without a data structure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><B>EA:</B></td>
    <td>I started by working the problem by hand. I wrote the code. I traced it when I had errors in the code to find out where I had made the mistake when the error was not readily apparent. The problem was not big enough that it needed to be broken down into subproblems. Writing the algorithm without the data structure was simple, obviously the algorithm was inefficient. When attempting to apply a data structure into this algorithm, the code had to be written and re-written 3 times! </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><B>L:</B></td>
    <td>I learned that sometimes the solution may be easier than what it really is.</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
