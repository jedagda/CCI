# Chapter 1 Problem 5

One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.

## IDEAL 
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><B>I:</B></td>
   <td>Compare two string, count the number of differences both strings have. Determine whether there is less than one difference between both strings</td>
    <tr>
    <td><B>D:</B></td>
    <td>Determine whether there is less than one difference between both strings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><B>EA:</B></td>
    <td>I worked some instances by hand, I found patterns, and then I translated it into code. I ran the code with several entries. If I was not getting the desired results I would trace the code to see where I had the logic errors in the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><B>L:</B></td>
    <td>Double check the logic of the code to minimize the errors</td>
  </tr>
</table>
